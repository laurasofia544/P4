                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>My name is Laura Loaiza. I am 18 years old and majoring in Business and Information Systems. I was born in Colombia and moved here when I was 8 years old. I've always loved reading books, especially because I saw it as an opportunity to improve my english.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="question">What's Your Favorite Book?</li>
                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>My Favorite book as of right now is "Reminders of Him" by Colleen Hoover. I finished reading that book in less than a day and absolutely loved every second of it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="question">What was your reading goal for this year?</li>
                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>Well it was supposed to be around 10 books this year but I wasn't able to complete it because I got a job and started school again</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="question">What would be one book you would recommend to anyone?</li>
                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>Even though my favorite book is "Reminders of Him" I would recommend "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo" by Taylor Jenkins Reid. It sounds like a romance book but it honestly doesn't focus on that too much. It's obviously present throughout the 
                    book but it's not the main focus. I feel like anyone would enjoy reading this book, no matter their gender, reading preferences, or anything like that. I continously recommend this book to anyone that asks me for one. </li>
